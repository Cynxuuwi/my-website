        <h2>Hey there! I'm Cyrus</h2>
        <p>I'm an 18-year-old passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it brings. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Information Systems, which perfectly aligns with my curiosity for computers, systems, and all things digital.</p>

        <p>While academics are important, I also find joy in esports and gaming. From strategizing with teammates to competing at local tournaments, I’ve learned the value of teamwork, focus, and competitive spirit. When I’m not gaming, I dive into my love for music—especially R&B. Artists like <strong>The Weeknd</strong> keep me company as I study, work on projects, or simply relax.</p>

        <p>Beyond my interests in gaming and music, I’m a big believer in personal growth and creativity. I’m always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself, whether that’s through my studies, hobbies, or discovering new skills.</p>

        <p>Feel free to explore my site, and I hope you find something that resonates with you. Whether it’s about technology, gaming, or just life in general, I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
