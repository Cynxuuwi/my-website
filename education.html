        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My academic journey began at <strong>Dasmariñas West National High School</strong>, where I spent four years in Junior High School. During Grade 9-10, I focused on <strong>Computer System Servicing (CSS)</strong>, which sparked my interest in technology and technical skills. Afterward, I continued my education at <strong>Emmanuel Ressurection Congressional Integrated High School</strong>, where I graduated with honors in Senior High School.</p>
