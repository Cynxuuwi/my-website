        <h2>Gaming & Esports</h2>
        <p>I love to compete in esports, especially in games like <strong>Valorant</strong>. I competed in <strong>TNC Dasmariñas</strong> in Valorant three times. I placed 3rd once and 2nd place twice, which was a big achievement for me. I also peaked at <strong>3,129th place</strong> in the <strong>Pacific (Asia) region</strong> on the Valorant leaderboards! Esports brings out my competitive side and helps me refine my skills in teamwork and strategy.</p>

        <h2>Tech & Gaming</h2>
        <p>As a <strong>BSIS student</strong>, I’m deeply passionate about technology, gaming, and all things digital. Whether I’m tinkering with gadgets, programming, or diving into online games, I enjoy learning and growing in the tech world.</p>
